# Calculator App #

***This is a simple Scala application that implements a calculator with support for basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The application makes use of Scala's built-in Future type for concurrency, allowing it to perform calculations asynchronously.
Getting Started***

**To run the application, you'll need to have Scala and sbt installed on your system.**

* Clone this repository to your local machine.

* Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

* Run sbt run to start the application.

**Usage**

Once the application is running, you can perform calculations by entering expressions. Here are some examples:

```
Calculator.calculate("+", Seq(1, 2))
```

```
Calculator.calculate("gcd", Seq(50, 25))
```
